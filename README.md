# Physics-Informed-ML
The repository provides a tutorial for the implementation of a physics informed neural network (PINN) to solve a continous heat conduction problem for a cube at an applied heat source on the surface. The PINN can be used to model the temperature fields within materials exposed to, e.g. laser irradiation in additive manufacturing. 

## Underlying physics
The underlying solved partial differential equation is the heat conduction: 
$\frac{d}{dt}u$


## Modeled domain
